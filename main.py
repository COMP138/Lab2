# initialize the variables below with the exact values shown in comments to the right of each variable name

# To do this, you must replace all ??? found in the code below the correct values
# don't forget to put quotes around collections of characters that represents words (like "Sunny" below)
# note that values we want to do "math" on do not need quotes!


wcondition =  "Sunny"   # DONE FOR YOU  Sunny (a string variable)
temperature=  ???   # 75.54 (a float variable)
tempUnits=  ???     # degrees (a string variable)
chanceOfRain=  ???  # 61 (an integer variable)
percent=  ???       # % (a string variable)
dayOfMonth=  ???    # 24 (an integer variable)
daySuffix=  ???     # th (goes after dayOfMonth, a string variable)
monthName=  ???     # June (a string variable)
cityName=  ???      # Larkspur (a string variable)
stateName=  ???     # California (a string variable)

# TODO: print a description of the weather using the variables provided above and the print() function
# add punctuation and spacing necessary to create a well-written sentence:
# The weather for the 24 th day of June in Larkspur, California will be Sunny and 75.54 degrees, with a 61% chance of rain.
# you must use all the VARIABLES defined above in your solution
# don't forget to use commas to separate arguments within your print statement's parentesis ( and )
